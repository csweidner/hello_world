CSCI E-12 assignment
After teaching American history for 30 years, --the last 22 at Lake Forest College--I am now semi-retired history professor. This is my last HES certificate course as I pivot toward the digital humanities.  CSCI E-12 has challenged me but I have learned a lot and plan to keep working on my website next semester.
